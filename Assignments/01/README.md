The infinite monkey theorem states that if a chimpanzee hits keys at random on a typewriter for an infinite amount of time, it will eventually type the complete works of William Shakespeare. Is this what evolution is doing? It has been argued that the genetic mutations required to move from a single cell to multicellular life are as unlikely as a monkey typing Hamletâ€™s soliloquy. But is evolution just a monkey banging on a typewriter?

  # Submission Instructions
  
  Follow along with the instructions in this PDF, filling in your own code, data, and observations as noted. Your own data should be inserted into the latex code of the PDF and recompiled. All code must be done in MATLAB. The basic structure of the code and fitness function are provided, but all code should be submitted as a separate zipped file in LEA. Relevant sections of code can be inserted directly into this document using the mcode latex package. This package is attached with documentation, and in this document I have provided usage examples.
